## Welcome to AD 698

**Applied Generative AI for Business**  - A course focused on **building** generative AI systems—  
not just using them.

---

## How We Interact with AI

We begin by typing a request into a chat box—  
a question, a description, an idea.

This request is called a **prompt**.

From a prompt, AI can:

- Create stories  
- Generate images  
- Compose music  
- Write code  
- Summarize information  
- Produce new ideas  

---

## How AI Creates

LLMs generate content by learning patterns from enormous volumes of data.

The output often feels:

- New  
- Impressive  
- Hard to distinguish from human-created content  

But generative AI also has limitations.

---

## The Challenges

Generative AI can be misused:

- **Deepfakes** — realistic but fabricated images/videos  
- **AI-written text** — nearly indistinguishable from human text  
- **Hallucinations** — answers that sound correct but are factually wrong  

Understanding these limitations is essential.


## The AD 698 Philosophy

This is **not** a course where the AI solves everything for you.

This is a **build-the-LLM-system** course.

You will learn how to design, construct, and evaluate  
**responsible, reliable generative AI workflows**.

---

## Seven Modules (0–6)

You will build the components of a complete LLM application:

1. **Module 0:** Generative AI foundations  
2. **Module 1:** Structured prompting  
3. **Module 2:** In-context learning  
4. **Module 3:** Embeddings & retrieval (RAG)  
5. **Module 4:** Building task-specific LLMs  
6. **Module 5:** Agents & automation  
7. **Module 6:** Evaluation & safety  

Each module adds a new layer to your final system.


## Build AI Systems Step-by-Step

You will learn to engineer:

- Prompt architectures  
- Structured output pipelines  
- In-context learning templates  
- Embedding models  
- Vector databases (ChromaDB / FAISS)  
- Retrieval-augmented systems  
- Domain-scoped LLM workflows  
- Agents that interact with APIs  
- Evaluation and safety mechanisms  


# Course Modality & Tools

## Weekly Rhythm

Each week includes:

- Short lecture videos  
- Live or recorded demos  
- Hands-on labs  
- Structured assignments  

All leading toward your final project.

---

## Tools You Will Use

- **Python** and **Jupyter Notebooks**  
- **OpenAI, Gemini, and OSS models**  
- **ChromaDB or FAISS**  
- **Streamlit** for interfaces  
- **SQL + Python connectors**  
- **GitHub & Quarto** for reproducible workflows  

These are the same tools used in modern AI and analytics teams.

---

# Applied Learning

## Hands-On Work

You will complete:

- Labs in prompting, embeddings, retrieval, and agents  
- Assignments that assemble entire LLM pipelines  
- A multi-stage **final project**  
- A published **Quarto website** documenting your work  

---

## Your Final Project

You will **design, build, and evaluate**  
a domain-specific generative AI application.

You’ll integrate:

- Task-specific behavior  
- Retrieval  
- Evaluation  
- Safety controls  
- A simple interactive interface  

All documented and published on GitHub.

---

# Human Responsibility

## Using AI Thoughtfully

Generative AI can create incredible things—  
but it can also mislead, hallucinate, and be misused.

Quality depends on:

- Good data  
- Good system design  
- Good evaluation  
- Thoughtful human oversight  

In AD 698, **the AI does the heavy lifting—  
but *you* remain responsible for the facts.**

---

# Closing

## Welcome to AD 698

This course will challenge you,  
expand your technical abilities,  
and give you the tools to build  
the next generation of generative AI systems.

Let’s get started.
