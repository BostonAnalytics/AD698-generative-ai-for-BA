# Important Reminder {.unnumbered}

- This assignment may be completed using [Google Colab]{.uublue-bold} or [AWS Academy]{.uublue-bold}.
- Your goal is to [understand and implement the NLP pipeline]{.uugreen-bold} not to scale it.
- It will be [impossible to run anything on your local machine (mac or PC)]{.uured-bold}. Please use Google Colab or request AWS Academy labs.
- [The assignment takes significant time to complete. Start early!]{.uublue-bold}

# Objective {.unnumbered}

:::{.callout-note}
This assignment introduces the [end-to-end NLP lifecycle]{.uured-bold} using real corporate disclosures.
You may use any generative AI tool, but you must still [build and explain the pipeline yourself]{.uugreen-bold}.
:::

You will analyze 2024 Form 10-K filings to answer the following business question:

:::{.callout-important}
Can corporate risk language be used to understand and predict industry-level risk exposure?
:::

This assignment establishes the [cleaned corpus, labels, and baselines]{.uugreen-bold} that will be reused in [Assignments 2–5]{.uugreen-bold}, where you will build [LLM-based and RAG pipelines]{.uugreen-bold}.


# Business Context {.unnumbered}

An investment firm is reassessing sector exposure amid increasing uncertainty related to:

-  regulation
-  technological disruption
-  operational risk
-  macroeconomic volatility

Rather than relying only on numerical indicators, the firm wants to understand how companies describe risk in their own words.

Each Form 10-K filing includes a Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code, which will be used as a high-level industry label for analysis and prediction.


# Data Source {.unnumbered}

You will use SEC-provided TXT versions of 2024 Form 10-K filings, available here:

## SEC 2024 Form 10-K TXT Files {.unnumbered}

- You will use all SEC-provided TXT versions of 2024 Form 10-K filings contained in the shared Google Drive folder.
- All files in the folder must be processed programmatically.
- You may later filter, subset, or group the data for analysis, but your NLP pipeline must be capable of ingesting the entire corpus.

[2024 SEC 10-K Filings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q7BfsNHCewG1zNfnqyCcBj9p_RUt-zW6?usp=sharing)


## Accessing the Files in Google Colab {.unnumbered}

### Add Folder to Your Drive {.unnumbered}

1. Open the link above.
2. Right-click the folder → Add shortcut to Drive
3. Save it in My Drive

### Mount Drive in Colab {.unnumbered}

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

### Verify Files {.unnumbered}

```python
import os
os.listdir("/content/drive/MyDrive")
```

Adjust paths as needed.

# How should the 10-K corpus be constructed for industry-level analysis? {#sec-q1}

## Business Goal

- Loa
- Create a clean, reproducible corpus that supports comparison across industries.
- You can choose 7 different industries from the [SEC filings](https://www.sec.gov/search-filings/standard-industrial-classification-sic-code-list).
- Justify why your selection is rational and what are you gaining from it.

## Technical Instructions

1. Load and process all Form 10-K TXT files in the shared folder:
   1. Do not manually select files
   2. Your code must iterate over the directory programmatically
2. For each filing:
   1. Load the full TXT file
   2. Extract:
     1. Item 1A – Risk Factors
     2. Item 7 – MD&A
   3. Extract and store:
     1. company identifier
     2. SIC code
3. Build a structured corpus where each record contains:
   1. company
   2. SIC code
   3. section name
   4. cleaned text
   5. sentence-level chunks
4. Save intermediate artifacts:
   1. cleaned section text
   2. sentence-level files
   3. metadata tables
5. For analysis and reporting only, select:
   1. at least 10 industries

## Expected Outputs

 - Table: company → SIC → industry group → section length
 - Folder structure showing saved artifacts
 - Brief explanation of cleaning decisions

:::{.callout-important}
All Form 10-K files in the shared folder must be processed as part of the NLP pipeline.

For Questions 2–4, you may subset the processed corpus for analysis, visualization, and modeling.
:::

# How should corporate risk language be represented for NLP analysis? {#sec-q2}

> All text representations must be generated for the entire corpus, even if only a subset is used for downstream modeling.

## Business Goal

Determine how narrative risk disclosures should be numerically represented for analysis and prediction.

## Technical Instructions

1. Build a classical NLP representation:
   * TF-IDF on Item 1A text
   * Explain tokenization and stopword choices
2. Build a neural representation:
   * Sentence embeddings using a Hugging Face model
   * Aggregate to document-level embeddings
3. Ensure all representations retain:
   * company identifier
   * SIC code
   * section source (Item 1A or Item 7)
4. Compare representations:
   * dimensionality
   * sparsity
   * semantic coverage

## Expected Outputs

* Comparison table of representations
* Short explanation of trade-offs


# Can risk language predict industry membership? {#sec-q3}

> For modeling and evaluation, you may restrict the dataset to a subset of SIC groups with sufficient sample size.

## Business Goal

Evaluate whether how firms describe risk contains enough signal to predict industry classification.

## Technical Instructions

### Prediction Task

* Input: Item 1A risk text
* Target: SIC-based industry group (coarse-grained)

### Model A: Classical NLP

* TF-IDF features
* Logistic Regression or Linear SVM
* Report:

  * accuracy
  * confusion matrix

### Model B: Basic Neural NLP

* Sentence/document embeddings
* Feedforward neural network (MLP)
* Report:

  * accuracy
  * comparison vs classical model

### Analysis

* Compare model performance
* Identify industries that are frequently misclassified
* Discuss interpretability vs performance

## Expected Outputs

* Model performance table
* Confusion matrices
* Short technical discussion

# How reliable are NLP-based risk assessments for business decision-making? {#sec-q4}

## Business Goal

Assess whether these models are decision-ready for real investment use.

## Technical Instructions

1. Identify at least three failure cases, such as:
   * boilerplate language
   * ambiguous phrasing
   * sentiment mismatch
2. Perform manual validation:
   * inspect representative sentences
   * explain why models failed
3. Compare:
   * classical vs neural models
   * strengths and weaknesses
4. Write an executive summary ($\leq 1 $ page):
   * key findings
   * limitations
   * recommendations

## Expected Outputs

* Failure case table
* Executive-style memo


# Use of Generative AI {.unnumbered}

:::{.callout-important}
Generative AI tools may be used for:

* code assistance
* explanation
* summarization

They may not replace required pipeline steps.
:::

You must briefly document:

* where AI tools were used
* how outputs were validated or modified


# Looking Ahead {.unnumbered}

:::{.callout-note}
In Assignments 2–5, you will:

* replace classical models with large language models
* build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines
* use vector search and neural retrieval

The cleaned corpus, SIC labels, sentence chunks, and embeddings created here will be reused directly.
