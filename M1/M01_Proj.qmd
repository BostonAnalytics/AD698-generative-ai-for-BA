# Objective and Context

This project is designed for **teams of 3–5 students**, where each team will act as a **domain-specific AI systems engineering group** building a section-scoped Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system over 2024 SEC 10-K filings.

Rather than building a generic financial chatbot, each team will select a **domain focus** and restrict their RAG system to the relevant SEC 10-K items.

Each team must:

* Select a domain track (e.g., Finance, HR, AI, Governance, Marketing, IS, Risk)
* Identify the relevant 10-K item(s)
* Build a section-scoped RAG system
* Clean and chunk that section rigorously
* Implement retrieval and grounded generation
* Evaluate reliability and hallucination behavior

This project reflects how enterprise AI systems are scoped by regulatory structure and business domain.

# Domain-Based Project Tracks

:::{.callout-note}
The SEC Form 10-K is a comprehensive annual report required of publicly traded companies in the United States. It is not a single narrative document — it is a regulatorily structured disclosure framework divided into four major Parts, each containing numbered Items that correspond to specific reporting obligations.

Understanding this structure is essential because your RAG system must operate within these regulatory boundaries.

There are 4 parts and 16 items in total (listed below), but not all items are relevant to every domain. For example, if you choose a Finance track, you might focus on Part II (Financial Information) and select items like MD&A or Financial Statements. If you choose a Governance track, you might focus on Part III (Governance and Executive Structure) and select items related to directors and compensation.
:::


:::{.panel-tabset}
## Part I

**Business and Risk Overview:** Focuses on operational description and risk disclosure.

* **Item 1** – Business
* **Item 1A** – Risk Factors
* **Item 1B** – Unresolved Staff Comments
* **Item 2** – Properties
* **Item 3** – Legal Proceedings
* **Item 4** – Mine Safety Disclosures

This section provides strategic positioning, industry context, and operational risk exposure.

## Part II

**Financial Information and Market Risk:** Focuses on performance, accounting data, and financial condition.

* **Item 5** – Market for Common Equity
* **Item 6** – Selected Financial Data
* **Item 7** – Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A)
* **Item 7A** – Market Risk Disclosures
* **Item 8** – Financial Statements
* **Item 9** – Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants
* **Item 9A** – Controls and Procedures
* **Item 9B** – Other Information

This section is heavily quantitative and forward-looking.

## Part III

**Governance and Executive Structure:** Focuses on management, ownership, and compensation.

* **Item 10** – Directors and Corporate Governance
* **Item 11** – Executive Compensation
* **Item 12** – Security Ownership
* **Item 13** – Related Transactions and Independence
* **Item 14** – Principal Accounting Fees and Services

This section reveals incentive structures and governance controls.

## Part IV

**Exhibits and Summary:** Administrative and supporting documentation.

* **Item 15** – Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules
* **Item 16** – Form 10-K Summary

These items primarily contain technical attachments and summaries.

:::

Below are recommended domain tracks mapped to SEC 10-K items. Teams must choose one track. These are meant to be illustrative, and teams can propose alternative tracks if they justify the item selection. 


# Key Areas of Analysis (Teams Choose One Focus Area)

Each team will **select one domain track** and restrict their RAG system to the relevant SEC 10-K Item(s).

Multiple teams may choose the same domain, but systems must demonstrate:

- Cleaning strategy
- Retrieval tuning
- Evaluation insights

Teams may also propose a related focus area, provided it maps clearly to one or more specific 10-K Items.

# Project Milestones: Engineering a Section-Scoped SEC 10-K RAG System

This project progresses through five technical milestones. Each milestone represents a system capability that builds toward a fully validated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform.


## Milestone 1 — Section Extraction & Cleaning Infrastructure

The foundation of your system begins with extending the **10K-Filings-Analyzer** repository.

At this stage, you will:

* Select your domain track and corresponding SEC 10-K Item(s).
* Extract only those sections from 2024 filings.
* Improve section boundary detection where necessary.
* Remove table-of-contents contamination, duplicated headings, signature blocks, and HTML artifacts.
* Normalize text formatting and encoding.

By the end of this milestone, you must produce a **clean, section-scoped dataset** suitable for LLM processing.

This milestone establishes the **data engineering layer** of your RAG system.


## Milestone 2 — Token-Aware Chunking & Metadata Engineering

Once section text is clean, it must be structured for retrieval.

At this milestone, you will:

* Implement token-aware chunking.
* Justify chunk size and overlap strategy.
* Attach structured metadata to every chunk:

  * CIK
  * Company name
  * Filing year
  * Section ID
  * Chunk ID
  * Token count

You should analyze chunk distributions and verify that regulatory formatting does not distort chunk logic.

By the end of this milestone, you will have an **LLM-ready structured corpus**.

This milestone transforms regulatory text into **retrievable computational units**.

## Milestone 3 — Embedding Layer & Section-Scoped Retrieval

Now you build the retrieval backbone.

At this milestone, you will:

* Generate embeddings for all chunks.
* Build a persistent vector index (FAISS or Chroma).
* Enforce strict metadata filtering by section.
* Demonstrate top-k retrieval with similarity scores.
* Prove that retrieval does not cross section boundaries.

By the end of this milestone, you will have a functioning **section-scoped retrieval system**.

This milestone constructs the **search intelligence layer** of your platform.


## Milestone 4 — Grounded RAG Generation Engine

With retrieval functioning, you now integrate generation.

At this milestone, you will:

* Implement a Question → Retrieval → Context Assembly → LLM Answer pipeline.
* Enforce structured JSON outputs.
* Require explicit citation of chunk_id and Item number.
* Implement refusal logic when evidence is insufficient.

Your system must successfully answer at least:

* 15 structured domain-specific questions
* Across 10 distinct firms

By the end of this milestone, you will have a complete **grounded RAG engine**.

This milestone integrates retrieval with controlled LLM reasoning.


## Milestone 5 — Evaluation and System Validation

The final milestone is validation and reliability assessment.

You must evaluate:

- Retrieval Accuracy
  - Create at least 20 labeled question–chunk pairs.
  - Compute Recall@k or Hit@k.
- Grounding Reliability
    - Measure citation coverage.
    - Estimate hallucination rate.
- Section Integrity
  - Demonstrate zero cross-item leakage.
- You must conclude with:
    - A system architecture diagram.
    - Quantitative performance summary.
    - Reflection on limitations and failure modes.

By the end of this milestone, you will have delivered a **validated enterprise-style RAG system**.
