## Overview

In this participation assignment, you will create a personal website to showcase your academic portfolio and achievements. This website will act as a professional representation of your skills, projects, and technical expertise, suitable for sharing with potential employers.

The website will be built using Quarto, a powerful open-source tool for creating professional-quality documents and websites. By the end of this assignment, you will have a polished personal website that highlights your technical abilities and personal accomplishments.

The website extends from the Lab 02 assignment, where you created a static version of your personal website and hosted it on GitHub Pages. In this participation, you will enhance your website by adding more content, refining the design, and customizing the layout to create a professional portfolio.

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) covers excellent material and articles for such development. [Machine Learning Engineer Portfolio](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/machine-learning-engineer-portfolio/) covers what you’ll want to include in a Machine Learning Engineer portfolio and how to build projects that’ll help you land a job.
