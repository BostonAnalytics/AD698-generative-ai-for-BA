# Lecture 5.1: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Concepts

## Highlights

* The limitations of static pretrained models in dynamic knowledge environments.
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as a system-level solution.
* Chunking strategies and document segmentation tradeoffs.
* Embedding-based indexing and similarity search.
* Grounding mechanisms to reduce hallucination risk.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

* Explain why standalone LLMs hallucinate under knowledge gaps.
* Describe the components of a basic RAG architecture.
* Design chunking strategies appropriate for different document types.
* Interpret embedding similarity as a retrieval signal.

# Lecture 5.2: Designing Retrieval-Augmented Pipelines

## Highlights

* End-to-end RAG workflow: ingestion → indexing → retrieval → generation.
* Query formulation and reformulation strategies.
* Citation tracing and evidence alignment.
* System evaluation metrics: retrieval precision vs generation quality.
* Limitations of RAG: context window constraints and retrieval noise.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

* Architect a retrieval-augmented workflow.
* Evaluate trade-offs between chunk size and retrieval accuracy.
* Implement citation-aware prompting structures.
* Diagnose failure points in retrieval and grounding systems.
