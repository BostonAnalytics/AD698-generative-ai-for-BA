# What We Learned

Module 5 shifted generative AI from isolated model behavior to **system architecture design**.

* **Hallucination as Distributional Extrapolation**
  We reframed hallucination as probabilistic inference beyond accessible knowledge.

* **Retrieval as Constraint Mechanism**
  Embedding-based retrieval narrows the output distribution by injecting relevant external context.

* **End-to-End Workflow Thinking**
  You learned how ingestion, indexing, querying, and generation form a coherent pipeline.

* **Grounding and Accountability**
  Citation tracing and structured prompting increase transparency in model outputs.

This module marks the transition from model-centric thinking to infrastructure-centric thinking.

# Preparing for Module 6

Module 6 explores **adaptation and system optimization**.

To prepare:

* Review the distinction between prompting, retrieval, and weight adaptation.
* Reflect on when modifying model weights is preferable to modifying context.
* Consider cost-performance tradeoffs in enterprise deployments.

Next, we move from retrieval to **efficient model adaptation and semantic analysis at scale**.
