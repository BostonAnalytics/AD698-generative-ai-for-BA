# What We Learned

Module 4 examined the structural engine behind modern generative AI.

* **Attention as Contextual Computation**
  We explored how self-attention enables models to dynamically weigh token relationships across long sequences.

* **Transformer Dominance**
  You saw why transformers replaced recurrent architectures in large-scale language modeling.

* **Scaling and Capability Growth**
  Increasing model size and training data changes performance characteristics and emergent behaviors.

* **Training and Governance Risks**
  We analyzed fine-tuning pipelines and the importance of preventing overfitting, leakage, and evaluation bias.

This module moved from prompting and surface interaction into the internal mechanics that determine model capability.

# Preparing for Module 5

Module 5 introduces **retrieval and grounded generation**, where we extend the model beyond its static training data.

To prepare:

* Review embedding similarity and vector search.
* Reflect on hallucination as extrapolation beyond training distribution.
* Consider why static models struggle with real-time knowledge updates.

Next, we will move from pure generation to **grounded system architecture through retrieval augmentation**.
