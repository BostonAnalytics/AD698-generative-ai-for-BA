# Lecture 4.1: Transformers, Attention, and Context

## Highlights

* The limitations of RNNs and LSTMs in modeling long-range dependencies.
* Self-attention as a mechanism for dynamic contextual weighting.
* Query, key, and value matrices in attention computation.
* Positional encoding and sequence order representation.
* Scaling intuition: why transformers improve with model size and data.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

* Explain self-attention mathematically at a conceptual level.
* Compare transformer architectures with recurrent models.
* Describe how positional encoding preserves sequence information.
* Understand why scaling improves emergent model capabilities.

# Lecture 4.2: Training Paradigms and Fine-Tuning Pipelines

## Highlights

* Pretraining objectives and large-scale corpus learning.
* Supervised fine-tuning and instruction tuning.
* Dataset formatting and alignment strategies.
* Risks of overfitting, data leakage, and evaluation contamination.
* Governance implications in model deployment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

* Distinguish between pretraining and fine-tuning stages.
* Design basic fine-tuning pipelines responsibly.
* Identify common data leakage risks in generative workflows.
* Evaluate trade-offs between generalization and specialization.
