# Lecture 6.1: Efficient Adaptation — LoRA, QLoRA, and PEFT

## Highlights

* Why full fine-tuning is computationally expensive and operationally risky.
* Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) as a structured alternative.
* LoRA and QLoRA mechanisms: low-rank updates and quantization strategies.
* Trade-offs between prompting, retrieval augmentation, and weight adaptation.
* Cost governance and deployment implications in enterprise settings.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

* Explain how LoRA modifies transformer weights efficiently.
* Compare full fine-tuning with PEFT approaches.
* Evaluate when adaptation is preferable to retrieval or prompting.
* Assess cost-performance trade-offs in deployment decisions.

# Lecture 6.2: Semantic Search, Clustering, and Change Detection

## Highlights

* Embedding-based semantic search in large corpora.
* Clustering techniques for document grouping in vector space.
* Similarity metrics and neighborhood analysis.
* Longitudinal semantic drift detection across time.
* Monitoring model outputs and corpus evolution.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

* Implement embedding-based clustering strategies.
* Interpret cluster structure within high-dimensional semantic space.
* Detect semantic shifts in evolving document collections.
* Connect semantic analytics to governance and risk monitoring.
