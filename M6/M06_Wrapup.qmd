# What We Learned

Module 6 expanded generative AI from retrieval design to **adaptive optimization and semantic analytics**.

* **Adaptation as Strategic Intervention**
  We analyzed when modifying model weights through LoRA or PEFT is more appropriate than adjusting prompts or retrieval context.

* **Cost-Aware System Design**
  Efficient fine-tuning balances computational expense with performance gains.

* **Semantic Insight at Scale**
  Embedding-based clustering and search enable large-scale document intelligence.

* **Monitoring and Drift Awareness**
  Systems evolve over time, and embedding drift analysis becomes critical for governance and reliability.

This module connects model engineering with analytical intelligence and operational oversight.

# Preparing for Module 7

Module 7 integrates long-context reasoning and multimodal systems.

To prepare:

* Review context window limitations and token budgeting.
* Reflect on summarization as compression rather than simplification.
* Consider how text, images, and structured data might share representation space.

Next, we conclude with **context management and multimodal generative systems**, completing the full GenAI systems lifecycle.
