# Overview {.unnumbered}


In this participation assignment, you will work in **groups** to study, synthesize, and present a **foundational or state-of-the-art research paper** in Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), or reproducible computational practice.

The goal is **not** to reproduce the paper technically, but to:

* Understand *why* the paper mattered
* Explain *what problem* it solved
* Situate it within the **modern GenAI stack**
* Critically assess its **assumptions, limitations, and downstream implications**

Each group will deliver a **short academic-style presentation** aimed at a technically literate but non-specialist audience (e.g., analytics managers, graduate students, applied researchers).

This assignment emphasizes:

* Conceptual clarity
* Systems thinking
* Research literacy
* Responsible AI awareness


# Goals {.unnumbered}

By completing this assignment, you will:

* Develop the ability to **read and interpret AI research papers**
* Learn how modern GenAI systems evolved from earlier computational ideas
* Practice explaining complex ideas clearly and precisely
* Engage critically with **reproducibility, scale, alignment, and responsibility**
* Strengthen academic and professional presentation skills


# Paper Selection (One Paper per Group)

- Everyone must read through the curated list below.
- Papers are organized by **theme**. 
- Each group will need to present a presentation on one of the papers from the week's theme listed under numbered list.
- Names of the papers are listed in the table and are also available at the end of this document.
- You can also search these papers on [scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com). 

## Group 11 – Governance & Deployment

* Foundation Models Paper [@bommasani2022opportunities]
* Red Teaming Language Models [@Ganguli2022RedTeaming]

# Presentation Expectations

## Presentation Length

* **10–12 minutes total**
* **5–7 slides**
* All group members must participate

## Suggested Slide Structure

Your presentation **must include**:

1. **Problem Framing**

   * What problem did this paper address?
   * Why was it important *at the time*?

2. **Core Contribution**

   * Key idea, model, framework, or insight
   * What changed because of this paper?

3. **Technical Intuition (Not Math-Heavy)**

   * Diagrams encouraged
   * Focus on system logic, not equations

4. **Impact and Legacy**

   * How does this paper influence modern GenAI systems?
   * Where do we see it today?

5. **Limitations and Critique**

   * What does the paper *not* address?
   * What assumptions may no longer hold?

6. **Relevance to This Course**

   * How does this connect to:

     * Prompting
     * RAG
     * Fine-tuning
     * Reproducibility
     * Responsible AI


# Submission Requirements

1. **Presentation Slides (PDF)**
2. **One-page Paper Brief (PDF)** including:
   - Paper citation
   - Key contribution (≤150 words)
   - One critique
   - One open research question


## Hints and Best Practices

* Focus on **ideas**, not implementation details
* Assume your audience understands Python and ML basics
* Use diagrams over equations
* Avoid reading slides verbatim
* Practice explaining the paper *without jargon*


This assignment is designed to help you **think like a researcher and systems designer**, not just a tool user.
Choose wisely, read deeply, and present with clarity.
