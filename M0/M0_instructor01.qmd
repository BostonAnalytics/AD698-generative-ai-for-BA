## Nakul R. Padalkar
::: {.columns}

Hi, I’m Nakul Padalkar, Associate Professor of Practice in Applied Business Analytics at Boston University. With a Ph.D. in Management Information Systems from Texas Tech University and over a decade of experience across industry and academia, my career has explored how technology shapes how we live, work, and understand the world. I am particularly passionate about the intersection of technology, economics, and society—how innovations like blockchain, machine learning, and AI can drive positive change in our communities.

I’ve been fortunate to work on academically rigorous and practically impactful projects throughout my career. My research often tackles real-world challenges, from improving supply chain transparency using blockchain technology to exploring the societal implications of artificial intelligence. In my work, I aim to blend theoretical insights with actionable strategies, whether through publishing papers on topics like AI in financial markets or designing courses that equip students to thrive in data-driven fields.

My work has been a combination of my professional and personal interests, which often overlap in surprising ways. For example, I’m a photography enthusiast and love incorporating my photos into my computer vision classes. Capturing a moment in a single frame or exploring the nuances of a new landscape offers me fresh perspectives that I can bring back to the classroom.

Beyond teaching and research, I’m a lifelong learner and traveler. Exploring new places, cultures, and cuisines broadens my outlook and brings depth to my work. Travel and technology share something in common: they allow us to cross boundaries, connect with diverse perspectives, and learn continuously.
