- We will focus on the tools you _actually_ need to start working collaboratively and putting your work under version control.
- Git is extremely powerful and sophisticated,
- and you can do fun things with it (as fun as programming gets!).
- The :notebook: [documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is very thorough,
- but can often be overwhelming :exploding_head: if you are just starting.

## What is Git? 

- A distributed version control system for code
- [Version control]{.uured-bold}: every change you make is tracked and versioned, so it's easy to rollback to an older state, or to keep multiple states in parallel without overwriting each other
- [Distributed]{.uured-bold}: your copy of the code is but one of many possible copies. 
- Git provides mechanisms for multiple authors to work on the same code at the same time and to merge their changes together

---

## Why you should use Git 

- To be kind to yourself
- To be kind to your collaborators
- To ensure your work is reproducible


### And because it's fun!

- :man_scientist: :triangular_ruler: It imposes a certain discipline to your programming.
- :nerd_face::fire: You can be braver when you code: if your new feature breaks, you can revert back to a version that worked!
- :space_invader: :file_folder: Keeps multiple (older and newer) versions of everything (not just source code)

---

## What it can do for you 

:::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

- [Version Control]{.uured-bold}: Easily track changes to code, data, & notebooks for efficient management & experimentation.
- [Collaboration]{.uured-bold}: Enable seamless teamwork, code sharing, & joint analysis with colleagues.
- [Experiment Tracking]{.uured-bold}: Keep records of model iterations, hyperparameters, & analysis approaches.
- [Reproducibilit & Code Sharing]{.uured-bold}: Document & reproduce results by capturing code & data changes.
- [Code Sharing]{.uured-bold}: Share reusable code snippets, preprocessing steps, & models.

:::


:::{.column width="50%"}

- [Branching]{.uured-bold}: Experiment with new ideas & analysis directions without disrupting the main workflow.
- [Integration]{.uured-bold}: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing & deployment.
- [Documentation]{.uured-bold}: Use commits as documentation for analysis steps, aiding reporting.
- [Career Growth]{.uured-bold}: Mastering Git enhances collaboration, contributing to career advancement.

## What we will cover

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  - The software that allows us to do version control. 
  - Like the "Track Changes" feature from Microsoft Word, but more rigorous, powerful, and scaled up to multiple files.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
  - Hosting service for git projects — essentially Dropbox for git projects.
  - You can host [remote]{.uured-bold} repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/). 
  - You edit and work on your content in your [local]{.uured-bold} repository on your computer, and then you send your changes to the remote.
  - Through the [Command Line Interface (CLI)]{.uured-bold} using [Github-CLI](https://cli.github.com/) or [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  - You can interact with Git using the [Graphical User Interface (GUI)]{.uured-bold} provided by [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
  - You can also use third-party GUIs like [Tower Git](https://www.git-tower.com/) or [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client).
- I like [Git CLI](https://cli.github.com/) and [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client), both are available through [Github Education](https://education.github.com/pack)

## Stop and execute

[Have you installed the following on your computer?]{.uured-bold}

1. **Set Up Git Locally**:
   1. Install Git: [Git Installation](https://git-scm.com/)
   2. Connect GitHub with Git: [Connecting GitHub to Git](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
2. **Download GitHub Desktop** (Optional): If you prefer a graphical interface: [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
3. **Learn Git and GitHub Basics**: - GitHub offers excellent beginner tutorials: [GitHub Docs - Getting Started](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)


## Setting up Github Education Account

Step 1: Go to the GitHub website: 

- [GitHub Sign-up](https://github.com/signup?source=login)

![](./M0_lecture01_figures//welcome-sign-up-github-account.png){width="75%" fig-align="center"}


--- 

## Signing up

### Step 2: Enter Your Details

- Fill in the following details:
  - **Email Address** -  Provide a valid email address.
    - Use your personal email address, not your university email address.
    - We will add your university email address later.
  - **Password** -  Create a strong password.
  - **Username** - Choose a unique username for your account.
  - Select the **Start Puzzle** button to do so, and then follow the prompts.

![](./M0_lecture01_figures//welcome-github-enter-email.png){width="75%" fig-align="center"}

---


## Verifying your account

### Step 3: Verify Your Email Address

  1. GitHub will send a verification email to the address you provided.
  2. Next, GitHub sends a launch code to your email address. Type that launch code in the **Enter code** dialog, and then press **Enter**.
  3. After you verify your account, select the **Create account** button.

### Step 4: Choose Your Plan

1. After email verification, GitHub will ask you to choose a plan:
   - [Free]{.uugreen-bold} - For personal projects and open source contributions.
   - [Paid]{.uugreen-bold} - For additional features like private repositories for teams.
   - Most people start with the free plan: [GitHub Pricing](https://github.com/pricing).
2. Let's Set-up Github Education Benefits: [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/pack)

## Github Configuration

![](./M0_lecture01_figures//git-workflow-simple-vers.webp){width="95%"}

## Setting up Git 

- As a first-time set up, you need to tell Git who you are
- Open Git Bash and type the following commands:
  - In case of Windows, open windows terminal and type `Git Bash`
  - In case of Mac, open terminal and type `Git Bash`
- Enter (type don't copy and paste) these lines one by one (with appropriate changes):
  - Go to your [GitHub account email page](https://github.com/settings/emails) and copy your name and email address
  - use the one that looks like `487492+yourusername@users.noreply.github.com` 

```bash
git config --global user.name "Nakul Padalkar" 
git config --global user.email "2807210+nakulpadalkar@users.noreply.github.com "
```

- Make sure that you include here the same email you used for signing up on GitHub.
- Test if this worked by typing
- You only need to do this once on each computer you use once.

``bash
git config --list
```

---

## Installation (CLI)

### Git for Windows
- [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)


### MacOS

- [Download Git for MacOS](https://tinyurl.com/git-mac)
- Alternate: `brew install git`

---

## SSH key generation & setup

1. Check if your computer is already connected to GitHub

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

2. If it gives an error, then you're not connected.
3. Check what key pairs already exist on your computer.
  
```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

4. If SSH has been set up on the computer you’re using, the public and private key pairs will be listed. 
  1. The file names are either `id_ed25519`/`id_ed25519.pub` or `id_rsa`/`id_rsa.pub` depending on how the key pairs were set up.
  2. If they don’t exist on your computer, use procedure on the next slide to create them.

---

## Generating SSH Keys

5. Use following lines on command line or bash to generate your keys

:::{.panel-tabset}

### Windows

- Run `windows Terminal`, `Powershell`, or `command line`.
- `ssh-keygen`
- you will be asked to specify file location. Hit `Enter` on keyboard, this will use default location.
-  Once the key is generated you will be asked to generate a passphrase. You can skip this by hitting `Enter` on keyboard.
- Repeat the `passphrase` if you entered one, if not then hit `Enter` again.
-  This will generate the key for your computer

### MacOS

- Open a Terminal window. in Macintosh operating systems, find Terminal in the Dock or in the Utilities folder.
- Enter the following command: `ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -C "your_username"`.
- Make sure to replace `your_username` with your own value.
  - Example: `ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -C "jsmith"`.
  - Select enter and follow prompts.
  - A passphrase isn't required. Supply a passphrase or leave blank and select enter to continue.
- When successfully generated, you see these messages:
  - `Your identification has been saved in filename`.
  - `Your public key has been saved in filename.pub`.
- Search for the public and private key files in Finder.
- The two key files are named `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`.
:::

---

## Adding SSH key to GitHub

- Now that we have generated the SSH keys, we will find the SSH files when we check.
 
```bash 
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

- Follow the steps at [add the SSH key to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).
- Copy the public key to GitHub

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

---

## Adding SSH key to GitHub

- Now that we’ve set that up, let’s check our authentication again from the command line.

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

It should say, 
```bash
Hi <Your Name>! You have successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

# Using GitHub Desktop

## The basic workflow 

### First time

1. [Clone]{.uured-bold} the repository that you want to work on from GitHub onto your local machine
2. Work on the files/scripts
3. Next, you will [commit]{.uured-bold} your changes and include an informative message, e.g. "Plot distribution of precipitation"
4. Then, you will [push]{.uured-bold} your changes to the remote repository

### Subsequent times

1. [Pull]{.uured-bold} any changes from the remote repository that your collaborators might have made
2. Repeat steps 2-4 above

---

## Working with GitHub

There are two ways to work with GitHub projects.

- Create the repository on GitHub, clone it to your PC, and work on it.[Recommended]{.uured-bold}
- Work on your project locally then create the repository on GitHub and push it to remote.
