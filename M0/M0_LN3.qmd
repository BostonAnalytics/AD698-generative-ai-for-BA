## FAQs (Read These First!) {.unnumbered}

- Use your **BU student email** to activate **Google Colab Pro**.
- You may use **VS Code, Cursor, or Antigravity-style workflows**.
- **All instructor demos and support will use VS Code**.
- Colab runtimes are **ephemeral**. Anything not saved to **Google Drive** will be lost.
- Always verify that your runtime is using a **GPU or TPU** before running large models.
- Do **not** store API keys or credentials directly in notebooks or public repositories.


## Questions {.unnumbered}

- Each section contains required setup actions.
- Sections marked **Required** must be completed for successful assignment execution.
- These steps are foundational for AD 698.



## Overview {.unnumbered}

All programming work for **AD 698 (Applied Generative AI)** will be executed using **Google Colab Pro** as the remote execution environment.

The course uses a modern **antigravity-style execution model**:

- **Authoring:** Local editor (VS Code, Cursor, Antigravity)
- **Execution:** Google Colab runtime (GPU / TPU)
- **Persistence:** Google Drive
- **Version control:** GitHub (private repositories)

Students do not manage cloud infrastructure such as EC2, SSH, or networking.


## Learning Outcomes {.unnumbered}

After completing this module, you should be able to:

* Configure and run notebooks using Google Colab Pro
* Attach GPU/TPU accelerators correctly
* Persist data and models using Google Drive
* Use VS Code or equivalent editors with Colab as a remote kernel
* Avoid common runtime and persistence failures


## Development Environment Choice

You may use **any notebook-capable development environment**, including:

* **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
* **Cursor**
* **Antigravity-style notebook workflows**
* Google Colab browser interface (allowed, not recommended)

There is **no grading penalty** based on editor choice.

> **Instructor Default:**
> All lectures, demos, screenshots, and debugging support will use **VS Code**.


## Execution Model

Regardless of editor choice:

* Code executes on **Colab-managed hardware**
* GPUs/TPUs must be explicitly enabled
* Google Drive is required for persistence
* GitHub is required for version control

Your editor choice does **not** affect grading, runtime limits, or submission requirements.


## Accessing Google Colab

1. Go to **[https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)**
2. Sign in using your **BU Google account**
3. Confirm that **Colab Pro** is active

Do not use personal Gmail accounts for course work.


## Creating or Opening a Notebook

Recommended project structure:

```
AD698/
 ├── notebooks/
 ├── data/
 ├── models/
 ├── outputs/
 └── README.md
```

This repository must be a **private GitHub repository**.


## Attaching a Colab Runtime (Required)

From your editor or the Colab interface:

* Select **Colab** as the kernel
* Choose a hardware accelerator:

  * **GPU** (default for AD 698)
  * **TPU** (TensorFlow/JAX only)

Always verify accelerator selection before execution.


## Verifying GPU Availability (Required)

Run immediately after connecting:

```python
import torch
print("CUDA available:", torch.cuda.is_available())
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print("GPU:", torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))
```

Optional diagnostic:

```python
!nvidia-smi
```

If no GPU is detected:

* Reopen the kernel selector
* Explicitly choose GPU
* Restart the runtime

## Mounting Google Drive (Required)

Google Drive is the persistence layer for this course.

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

Set your working directory:

```python
import os
os.chdir('/content/drive/MyDrive/AD698')
print(os.getcwd())
```

Anything not saved to Drive will be lost when the runtime resets.


## Package Management (Stateless Runtime)

Colab runtimes reset frequently. Install dependencies at the top of **every notebook**:

```python
!pip install -q transformers datasets accelerate peft
```

Rule:

> If it is not installed in the notebook, it does not exist.


## Optional: Built-in LLM Access (No API Key)

Colab Pro provides limited built-in LLM access for experimentation:

```python
from google.colab import ai
response = ai.generate_text(
    "Explain the difference between fine-tuning and prompt engineering."
)
print(response)
```

Use for:

* Prompt engineering labs
* Rapid experimentation
* In-class demonstrations

Graded assignments will primarily rely on **open-source models or explicit APIs**.


## Common Failure Modes {.unnumbered}

Most execution failures are caused by:

* Forgetting to enable GPU
* Forgetting to mount Google Drive
* Assuming packages persist across sessions
* Treating Colab like a local machine


## Conceptual Mapping: EC2 → Colab {.unnumbered}

| EC2 Concept     | Colab Equivalent    |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| VM instance     | Runtime session     |
| SSH login       | Kernel attach       |
| EBS storage     | Google Drive        |
| GPU instance    | Runtime accelerator |
| Port forwarding | Not required        |



## Final Instruction {.unnumbered}

> **Your editor is the control plane.
> Colab is the execution substrate.
> Google Drive is the disk.**

This is the default workflow for **AD 698**.
