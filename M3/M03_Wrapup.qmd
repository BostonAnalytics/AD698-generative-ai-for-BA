# What We Learned

Module 3 shifted the focus from representation to **control within representation**.

* **Prompting as Probability Shaping**
  We reframed prompts as structured mechanisms that guide model output by altering conditional distributions.

* **In-Context Learning as Implicit Adaptation**
  Few-shot examples modify local probability landscapes without changing model weights.

* **Semantic Geometry**
  Meaning exists in high-dimensional embedding space, where similarity corresponds to geometric proximity.

* **Failure and Drift**
  We examined why outputs degrade, shift semantically, or amplify ambiguity across iterations.

This module transforms prompting from trial-and-error to deliberate probabilistic design.

# Preparing for Module 4

Module 4 moves inside the model—into architecture and training mechanics.

To prepare:

* Review attention mechanisms conceptually.
* Reflect on why context length matters.
* Revisit how embeddings are used inside transformer layers.

Next, we examine the structural engine powering modern generative systems: **transformers and large-scale training paradigms**.
