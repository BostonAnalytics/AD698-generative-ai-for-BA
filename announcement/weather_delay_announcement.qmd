## Class Cancellation Due to Severe Weather

Based on the **Boston University Alert** and official university guidance issued today, **all classes scheduled for Monday are canceled** due to **severe winter weather conditions**.

This decision follows university-wide safety protocols and guidance communicated through BU Alert and posted on the Boston University website.

## Updated Course Start Date

As a result of this cancellation:

* **Classes scheduled for Monday will not meet**
* The **first class session** for this course will be held on **February 2**

There are **no required lectures, labs, or assignments** to complete during the canceled week unless explicitly announced otherwise.

## Next Steps

* The course schedule and deliverables will be updated to reflect the revised start date
* A **separate Week 1 announcement** will be posted prior to the February 2 class with onboarding details and platform access instructions
* Please continue to monitor **BU email and BU Alert** for any additional university-wide updates

Thank you for your understanding and flexibility. I look forward to beginning the course with you on **February 2** under safer conditions.
