## Welcome to the Course

Welcome to the course. I am **Professor Nakul Padalkar**, and I look forward to working with you this semester.

Due to **severe winter weather conditions**, the start of the course was delayed by one week. This announcement confirms that the course **officially begins today (Week 1)**. All lectures, labs, and assignments are now aligned with the revised schedule.

## AWS Academy – Generative AI Foundations (Important)

All students have been **successfully added** to the **AWS Academy Generative AI Foundations** course on the **AWS Academy platform**.

You should now see this course listed when you log in using your Boston University–associated AWS Academy account. You may receive automated onboarding emails from AWS; these are part of the standard setup process.

Key points to note:
