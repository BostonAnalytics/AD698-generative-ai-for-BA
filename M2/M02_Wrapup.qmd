# What We Learned

Module 2 moved from probability to **representation**.

* **Mathematical Structure of Meaning**
  We formalized how language models encode meaning using vectors and conditional probability.

* **Optimization and Information Theory**
  You learned how cross-entropy loss, entropy, and perplexity quantify uncertainty and drive model training.

* **Text Representation Evolution**
  We compared early statistical models (n-grams) with contextual embeddings used in modern systems.

* **Structured Text Awareness**
  We expanded beyond isolated tokens to understand document-level hierarchy, structure, and metadata.

This module establishes the bridge between statistical learning and semantic behavior.

# Preparing for Module 3

Module 3 introduces **prompting and semantic geometry**, where representation becomes control.

To prepare:

* Review cosine similarity and vector distance metrics.
* Reflect on how embedding spaces encode semantic neighborhoods.
* Consider how altering input phrasing might shift probability distributions.

Next, we will treat prompting not as text entry—but as **probability shaping within semantic space**.
