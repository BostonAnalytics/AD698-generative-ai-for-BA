# Lecture 2.1: Mathematical Foundations Through Language Modeling

## Highlights

* **Vectors as Meaning** — Distributed representations encode semantics geometrically.
* Conditional probability and maximum likelihood estimation in language models.
* Cross-entropy loss and why minimizing it improves predictive accuracy.
* Entropy and perplexity as measures of uncertainty and model performance.
* The connection between optimization objectives and behavioral outcomes in generative systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

* Interpret embeddings as high-dimensional semantic representations.
* Explain the role of conditional likelihood in training language models.
* Define cross-entropy and perplexity mathematically and conceptually.
* Connect optimization functions to observable model behavior.

# Lecture 2.2: From Words to Structured Text

## Highlights

* Tokenization strategies: word-level, subword, and normalization pipelines.
* N-grams and early statistical language modeling foundations.
* Static vs contextual representations of meaning.
* Document structure awareness: hierarchy, sections, tables, metadata.
* Why structural signals improve model grounding and retrieval.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

* Distinguish between symbolic and contextual text representations.
* Explain how tokenization choices affect downstream performance.
* Compare n-gram models with contextual embeddings.
* Recognize structural cues in long-form and enterprise documents.
