    "text": "2 Course Content and Objectives\n\n2.1 Course Description\nThis course is designed for analytics developers and advanced business students seeking to build practical, production-ready applications using Generative AI (GenAI). Emphasizing hands-on learning, students will explore key techniques such as prompt engineering, in-context learning (ICL), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), AI agents, and responsible AI design.\nStudents will work with open-source tools and APIs including LangChain, LlamaIndex, and embedding models, while learning to implement GenAI systems across the entire development lifecycle — from prompt design and knowledge retrieval to fine-tuning and deployment.\nThe course will emphasize practical development over theoretical model internals and will cover topics such as:\n\nModel optimization strategies (e.g., quantization, adapter-based tuning)\nInference pipelines and GenAI app deployment\nEvaluation and benchmarking of model performance\nResponsible and explainable GenAI usage in enterprise settings\n\nStudents will complete five applied assignments and a capstone project, culminating in the deployment of a custom GenAI-powered analytics application.\nThis course bridges the gap between business analytics fluency and technical AI development, equipping students to build domain-specific LLM applications that solve real-world problems."

    "text": "10 Class Policies\n\n10.1 Attendance & Absences\nClass attendance is mandatory. Please inform your instructor if you know in advance that you will need to miss a class. More than two absences will influence your participation grade in this class.\nRegularly engaging in discussions on course-related topics, any cases and readings (during the class and on the Discussion Board), asking questions that lead to better understanding of a concept by the class as a whole, clarifying concepts, readiness to help peers during the consultation sessions and between classes, and sharing professional experience about course-related topics constitute superior class participation and contribute to our collective learning.\n\n\n10.2 Submission Format\nAll written contributions should follow the APA writing style, in particular, the requirements how to lay out a paper, as well as how to cite and reference correctly You can get an excellent guide to APA style here.\n\n\n10.3 Assignment Completion & Due Dates & Late Work\nStudents should submit completed assignments on the Blackboard course website. All work requests from the instructor (quizzes, assignments, contributions in the teamwork, etc.) have due dates. These are the last dates that stated material is due. This means that it is a good idea to set personal targets before then as your personal completion date to avoid difficulties. Dates are often viewed by students as the date to turn in an assignment. We view assignment due dates as the last date on which to turn in an assignment. With this warning, please note that we are not inclined to accept late work; if late work should be accepted it will be done only after considerable weighing of rationale, and with penalty.\n\n\n10.4 Academic Conduct Code\nStudents are expected to adhere to the highest standards of honesty and integrity for this course. Cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated in any Metropolitan College course. They will result in no credit for the assignment or examination and may lead to disciplinary actions. Please take the time to review the Student Academic Code of Conduct\nThis should not be understood as a discouragement for discussing the material or your particular approach to a problem with other students in the class. On the contrary – you should share your thoughts, questions and solutions. Naturally, if you choose to work in a group, you will be expected to come up with more than one and highly original solutions rather than the same mistakes.\n\n\n10.5 Request for Accommodations\nIf you have a disability and will be requesting accommodations for this course, please inform the instructor early in the semester. Advance notice and appropriate documentation are required for accommodations."
