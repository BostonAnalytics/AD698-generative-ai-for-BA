# What This Course Is About

This course explores how modern generative AI systems reshape analytical workflows and business decision-making. You will learn:

- How natural language functions as a data type
- How LLMs process text, structure information, and generate content
- How GenAI integrates with business analytics pipelines
- How to build practical generative-AI solutions with Python, APIs, and automation
- How to critically evaluate model outputs, reliability, and risks
- How to design human–AI workflows and deploy GenAI tools effectively in organizations

---

# Why This Course Matters for Your Career

- Every analytics job now intersects with LLMs.
  - Analysts who master prompt engineering, RAG, automation, and LLM-based workflows will dramatically outperform peers.
-  [AI-augmented analysts]{.uured-bold} produce more work, more insight, and higher-value deliverables.
- Organizations expect you to understand:
  - How AI reads and structures unstructured data
  - How to integrate AI into dashboards, apps, and analytical workflows
  - Responsible use, privacy, transparency, and governance principles
- This course trains you in supporting interviews, project pitches, and job applications while responding to the [AI Augmented Analyst]{.uured-bold} roles.

# Participation Components

## LLM Lab Practice

* Weekly hands-on exercises using LLMs
* Focus on prompting, automation, and applied business tasks

## Tooling: GitHub, Python, APIs

* You will maintain a public portfolio repository
* Every assignment and project will be submitted via GitHub

---

# In-Class Labs

Labs are short, guided activities where you:

* Work directly with LLM models
* Explore generative workflows
* Build first-draft AI tools that feed into assignments
* Analyze data, automate tasks, and generate outputs
* Write practical reports and visualizations

**On-campus:** must submit weekly
**Online:** optional but recommended for practice

---

# Individual Assignments

Four structured assignments that build core competencies:

1. **Prompt Engineering & Automated Analytics**
2. **RAG and Vector Search**
3. **AI Pipeline for Business Intelligence**
4. **Automated Workflow + API Integration**

---

# Group Project

A semester-long generative-AI solution to a business problem.
