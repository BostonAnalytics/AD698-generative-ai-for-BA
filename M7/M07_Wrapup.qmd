# What We Learned

Module 7 completed the transition from isolated model behavior to **fully integrated generative systems**.

* **Context as Architecture**
  We analyzed how token limits, compression strategies, and memory systems shape model reliability.

* **Compression as Intelligence Engineering**
  Summarization and chunking are not convenience tools—they are structural constraints on probabilistic systems.

* **Multimodal Expansion**
  Generative AI extends beyond text, integrating images, structured data, and layout-aware document understanding.

* **Enterprise System Integration**
  We positioned multimodal models within enterprise workflows involving governance, compliance, analytics, and automation.

# Course Finalization: The Complete Arc

Across seven modules, the course built a layered understanding of generative AI:

1. **Probability** — Language modeling as conditional prediction.
2. **Representation** — Meaning encoded geometrically.
3. **Prompting** — Probabilistic control within embedding space.
4. **Architecture** — Attention mechanisms and scaling.
5. **Retrieval** — Grounded system design.
6. **Adaptation** — Efficient optimization and semantic analytics.
7. **Context & Multimodality** — Integrated, enterprise-ready systems.

You now understand generative AI not as a tool—but as a **probabilistic, architectural, and governance-driven system**.

# Moving Forward

As you conclude this course, you should be able to:

* Design reproducible GenAI workflows.
* Architect retrieval-augmented systems.
* Evaluate when to prompt, retrieve, or fine-tune.
* Manage context and memory constraints.
* Integrate multimodal inputs responsibly.
* Assess governance risks in deployment.

The intellectual progression is complete: from token probabilities to multimodal enterprise systems.

If you would like, I can now:

* Create a **final course reflection document**
* Build a **capstone/project rubric**
* Generate a **course roadmap visualization**
* Or consolidate all modules into a single structured course handbook**

Your GenAI systems course is now structurally complete.
