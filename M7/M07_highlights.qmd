# Lecture 7.1: Context Windows, Memory, and Compression

## Highlights

* Context window limitations and token budgeting strategies.
* Why longer context does not equal better reasoning.
* Summarization as probabilistic compression.
* Caching and memory hierarchies in generative workflows.
* Retrieval vs memory vs adaptation trade-offs.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

* Explain context window constraints in transformer models.
* Design workflows that manage long documents efficiently.
* Implement summarization as structured compression.
* Distinguish between retrieval, caching, and persistent memory systems.

# Lecture 7.2: Multimodal Generative Models and Structured Data

## Highlights

* Vision-language transformer architectures.
* Multimodal embeddings and shared representation spaces.
* Structured data (tables, JSON, metadata) in generative workflows.
* Document understanding across text, figures, and layouts.
* Enterprise applications of multimodal AI systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

* Describe how multimodal transformers integrate image and text inputs.
* Explain shared embedding spaces across modalities.
* Incorporate structured data into generative pipelines.
* Evaluate multimodal use cases in analytics, compliance, and enterprise automation.
