  abstract = {3rd edition. It's not easy to design good application interfaces in a world where companies must create compelling, seamless user experiences across an exploding number of channels, screens, and contexts. Design patterns, design systems, and component-based UI frameworks have emerged and now rapidly evolve to meet the challenge. This bestselling book is one of the few reliable sources to help you navigate through the maze of design options. By capturing UI best practices and reusable ideas as design patterns, Designing Interfaces provides solutions to common design problems that you can tailor to the situation at hand. This updated edition includes patterns for mobile apps and social media, as well as web applications and desktop software. Each pattern contains full-color examples and practical design advice that you can use immediately. Experienced designers can use this guide as a sourcebook of ideas; novices will find a roadmap to the world of interface and interaction design.},

  abstract  = {From the Publisher: Complete coverage of basic design principles illustrated by student examples. Design for Communication offers a unique approach to mastering the basic design principles, conceptual problem-solving methods, and critical-thinking skills that distinguish graphic designers from desktop technicians. This book presents forty-two basic to advanced graphic design and typography assignments collaboratively written by college educators to teach the fundamental processes, concepts, and techniques through hands-on applications. Each assignment is illustrated with actual student solutions, and each includes a process narrative and an educator's critical analysis revealing the reasoning behind the creative strategies employed by each individual student solution. Assignments are organized from basic to advanced within six sections: The elements and principles of design; Typography as image; Creative word play; Word and image; Grid and visual hierarchy; Visual advocacy. Design for Communication is a highly visual resource of instruction, information, ideas, and inspiration for students and professionals. Introduction -- What is graphic design -- What do graphic designers do -- I want to be a graphic designer-where do I begin -- Design process -- Why bother with such a long process when I just like to make things -- Why should I do these assignments -- Section 1: Elements And Principles Of Design -- Star symbol / Susan Merritt -- Object semantics / Kermit Bailey -- Symbol design / Lisa Fontaine -- Lettermark / Susan Merritt -- Vinyletteror / Kenneth Fitzgerald -- Letterform as shape / Jan Conradi -- Concert poster / Arnold Holland -- Design history chair / Hank Richardson -- Section 2: Typography As Image -- Shaping words / Richard Ybarra -- Newspaper stories-a typographic workshop / Jurgen Hefele -- Typographic self-portrait / Esen Karol -- Typographic self-portrait / Elizabeth Resnick -- Typeface poster / Hyun Mee Kim -- Directions poster / Frank Baseman -- Poetry in motion / Elizabeth Resnick -- Section 3: Creative Wordplay -- Descriptive pairs / Elizabeth Resnick -- Letters as image / Hyun Mee Kim -- Concrete poetry / Kenneth Fitzgerald -- Arthur Murray Dance advertisement / Frank Baseman -- CD cover: typographical music / Heather Corcoran -- Section 4: Word and image -- Word and image / Elizabeth Resnick -- Book cover design: the Interpretation of Dreams by Sigmund Freud / Elizabeth Resnick -- Book cover design: Einstein's Dreams by Alan Lightman / Elizabeth Resnick -- Postage stamp design: a celebration of cultural diversity in America / Elizabeth Resnick and Glenn Berger -- Postage stamp design: a celebration of American primary education: reading, writing, mathematics and science / Elizabeth Resnick -- Stamp design / Michael Burke -- Sculpture poster / Tom Briggs -- Gardening poster / Karen Bernstein -- Kitchen of meaning exhibition poster / Kermit Bailey -- Section 5: Grid and visual hierarchy -- Typographic history spread / Elizabeth Resnick -- Two-sided typography poster / Judith Aronson -- Three type specimens / Carol Sogard -- Visual poetry calendar / Peggy Re -- Science lecture series posters / Elizabeth Resnick -- Book: Lewis & Clark / Heather Corcoran -- Journey journal / Gulizar Cepoglu -- Section 6: Visual Advocacy -- Literacy poster: learn to read / Elizabeth Resnick -- Human rights poster / Elizabeth Resnick -- Designing dissent: advocacy poster series / Elizabeth Resnick -- Happy Deutschland / Jurgen Hefele -- Three-dimensional direct response (mail) solicitation / Elizabeth Resnick and Glenn Berger -- Tolerance Bus Shelter Poster / Frank Baseman -- Bibliography -- Instructor contact information -- Index.},

@article{Mikolov2013Efficient,
  abstract  = {We propose two novel model architectures for computing continuous vector representations of words from very large data sets. The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.},

@article{Enyan2024Distributional,
  abstract = {Distributional semantics is the linguistic theory that a word's meaning can be derived from its distribution in natural language (i.e., its use). Language models are commonly viewed as an implementation of distributional semantics, as they are optimized to capture the statistical features of natural language. It is often argued that distributional semantics models should excel at capturing graded/vague meaning based on linguistic conventions, but struggle with truth-conditional reasoning and symbolic processing. We evaluate this claim with a case study on vague (e.g. "many") and exact (e.g. "more than half") quantifiers. Contrary to expectations, we find that, across a broad range of models of various types, LLMs align more closely with human judgements on exact quantifiers versus vague ones. These findings call for a re-evaluation of the assumptions underpinning what distributional semantics models are, as well as what they can capture.},
