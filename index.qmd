## Course Content and Objectives

### Course Description

This course is designed for **analytics developers and advanced business students** seeking to build **practical, production-ready applications** using **Generative AI (GenAI)**. Emphasizing hands-on learning, students will explore key techniques such as **prompt engineering, in-context learning (ICL), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), AI agents, and responsible AI design**.

Students will work with **open-source tools and APIs** including **LangChain**, **LlamaIndex**, and **embedding models**, while learning to implement GenAI systems across the **entire development lifecycle** — from prompt design and knowledge retrieval to fine-tuning and deployment.

The course will emphasize **practical development** over theoretical model internals and will cover topics such as:

* Model optimization strategies (e.g., quantization, adapter-based tuning)
* Inference pipelines and GenAI app deployment
* Evaluation and benchmarking of model performance
* Responsible and explainable GenAI usage in enterprise settings

Students will complete **five applied assignments** and a **capstone project**, culminating in the **deployment of a custom GenAI-powered analytics application**.

This course bridges the gap between **business analytics fluency** and **technical AI development**, equipping students to build **domain-specific LLM applications** that solve real-world problems.


## Course Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- [Design and implement prompt workflows]{.uublue-bold} to extract relevant, accurate, and useful outputs from large language models using in-context learning (ICL) strategies.
- [Build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems]{.uublue-bold} that combine language models with structured and unstructured knowledge bases.
- [Develop autonomous AI agents]{.uublue-bold} that can reason, retrieve, and execute tasks across business workflows using frameworks such as LangChain and AutoGen.
- [Fine-tune and customize foundation models]{.uublue-bold} (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral) using parameter-efficient techniques like LoRA and QLoRA to adapt to business-specific domains.
- [Evaluate and audit generative models]{.uublue-bold} for quality, risk, bias, and alignment using both manual and automated tools (e.g., OpenAI Evals, GPT-judge, Trulens).
- [Deploy GenAI applications]{.uublue-bold} using lightweight serverless pipelines (e.g., Streamlit, FastAPI, GitHub Actions) and optimize for cost and performance.
- [Critically assess ethical and governance implications]{.uublue-bold} of deploying GenAI in enterprise settings, including risks of hallucination, misinformation, and data leakage.
- [Collaborate using modern software development workflows]{.uublue-bold}, including version control (Git/GitHub), cloud-based inference, and reproducible notebooks.

## Grading and Assessment

### Grading Structure

On the course homepage, all of the material is presented by modules and each module covers two lectures. In the on-campus version of this course, each week we will have a live classroom session that will cover one lecture. In addition, students will work in teams in our virtual labs and will participate in group discussion boards. Please review the Course Calendar & Outline document to get the full schedule of this course.

## Grading Breakdown

### Certification Points:

   1.	AWS Academy Generative AI Foundations

AWS Academy Generative AI Foundations is a self-paced course that will be completed in the first 10 weeks of the course. The final deliverable is completion badge from the AWS Academy. [Points are based on the AWS cloud module check grades translated to 100 points]{.bloodred-bold}.

### Weekly Labs (On Campus Class Only):

The labs consist of Weekly Quizzes and Problem Solving Exercises. Each week, students will take part in a set of focused weekly in class exercise that concern the material covered during that week’s content. Participation requirements include the jupyter or quarto notebook. These assignments will be done individually. The exercises are due by Day 6 at 11:59 PM.

## Class Policies

### Attendance & Absences

Class attendance is [mandatory]{.bloodred-bold}. Please inform your instructor if you know in advance that you will need to miss a class. More than two absences will influence your participation grade in this class.

Regularly engaging in discussions on course-related topics, any cases and readings (during the class and on the Discussion Board), asking questions that lead to better understanding of a concept by the class as a whole, clarifying concepts, readiness to help peers during the consultation sessions and between classes, and sharing professional experience about course-related topics constitute superior class participation and contribute to our collective learning.

### Submission Format

All written contributions should follow the APA writing style, in particular, the requirements how to lay out a paper, as well as how to cite and reference correctly You can get an excellent guide to APA style here.

### Assignment Completion & Due Dates & Late Work

Students should submit completed assignments on the Blackboard course website. All work requests from the instructor (quizzes, assignments, contributions in the teamwork, etc.) have due dates. These are the last dates that stated material is due. This means that it is a good idea to set personal targets before then as your personal completion date to avoid difficulties. Dates are often viewed by students as the date to turn in an assignment. We view assignment due dates as the last date on which to turn in an assignment. With this warning, please note that we are not inclined to accept late work; if late work should be accepted it will be done only after considerable weighing of rationale, and with penalty.

### Academic Conduct Code

Students are expected to adhere to the highest standards of honesty and integrity for this course. Cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated in any Metropolitan College course. They will result in no credit for the assignment or examination and may lead to disciplinary actions. Please take the time to review the 
[Student Academic Code of Conduct](http://www.bu.edu/met/metropolitan_college_people/student/resources/conduct/code.html)

This should not be understood as a discouragement for discussing the material or your particular approach to a problem with other students in the class. On the contrary – you should share your thoughts, questions and solutions. Naturally, if you choose to work in a group, you will be expected to come up with more than one and highly original solutions rather than the same mistakes.

### Request for Accommodations

If you have a disability and will be requesting accommodations for this course, please inform the instructor early in the semester. Advance notice and appropriate documentation are required for accommodations.
